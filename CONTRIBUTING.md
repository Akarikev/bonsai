## Build Process

The project uses Vite for building and bundling. The build process:

1. Generates TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`)
2. Creates ESM and CommonJS bundles
3. Handles multiple entry points (main package and DevTools)
4. Automatically excludes DevTools from production builds

To build the project:

```bash
bun run build
```

### Type Declarations

Type declarations are automatically generated during the build process:

- `dist/index.d.ts`: Main package types
- `dist/devtools.d.ts`: DevTools types

These files are:

- Used for development and type checking
- Not included in production bundles
- Required for proper TypeScript support

### DevTools

The DevTools component is:

- Optional and only included when explicitly imported
- Automatically excluded from production builds
- Available as a separate entry point: `@bonsai-ts/state/devtools`

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Maintain strict type checking
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments
- Use meaningful type names
- Ensure type declarations are generated correctly

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types
- Follow React best practices
- Document component props and usage

### State Management

- Keep state updates predictable
- Document state shape
- Use middleware for side effects
- Maintain immutability
- Follow the established patterns for tree and flat state

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain test coverage
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Test edge cases
- Include benchmarks for performance-critical code
